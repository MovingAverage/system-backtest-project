# we choose BMW.DE for this example. Let'use only the adjusted prices since the
# beginning of 2012. The instruction "Ad" chooses the adjusted price only.
 
BMW = Ad(data$BMW.DE)["2012::"]
 
# Let's create a custom technical indicator that is the average of three simple
# moving averages and let's call it Av.TripleSMA. First we define a R custom 
# function that computes our indicator. We use simple moving averages (SMA)
# computed on 21, 42 and 63 days (roughly 1, 2 and 3 months):
 
Av.TripleSMA = function(x) {
ATS = (SMA(x, 21) + SMA(x, 42) + SMA(x, 63))/3
return(ATS)
}
 
# Then, we use the "newTA" instruction in order to make our indicator recognizable
# by quantmod. The "on = 1" argument tells quantmod to draw the indicator on the
# main plotting area of the chart (the same where the price is plotted).
 
custom.indicator = newTA(FUN = Av.TripleSMA, legend.name = "Av. Triple SMA", on = 1)
 
# Finally, we chart the price and the custom indicator with the following two
# instructions:
 
chartSeries(BMW, name = "BMW - Adj Prices", theme = chartTheme("white"))
custom.indicator()
